# To The Skies
To The Skies is an extensible work of interactive fiction. Basically, that means it's a choose your own adventure game, but people can add on to the "tree" of choices, meaning it could potentially be extremely large, and people could spend hours playing before reaching any sort of ending.
# What languages/frameworks/things does it use?
HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript is used on the front-end, with no major frameworks. Node.js with Express is used on the back-end. ArangoDB is used as the database, and is interacted with using ArangoJS.
# What state is it in currently?
It is currently in very early development, and at least a month or two out from even an alpha release.
# What is the pricing/business model?
It will be completely free to play. It is possible that ads, in-game-purchases, or something similar may be added. However, I personally hate p2w games, and I will make absolutely sure that any sort of paid things will be completely optional and not give a big boost to people who buy them, and To The Skies will be completely playable and enjoyable without paying a dime.
